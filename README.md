&nbsp; Korest Docs is a Kotlin library that extends [Spring REST Docs](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs). 
It makes creating API documentation easy using Kotlin DSL. 
You can generate API documentation using a test framework (e.g., MockMvc, RestAssured, WebTestClient) or simply by declaring it.
